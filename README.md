# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Using R to perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in a dataset predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes.

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
    Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?

    Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

    Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
    
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
    The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension 
    coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design 
    specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
    Briefly summarize interpretation and findings for the results.
    
## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition
    This statistical study quantifies how MechaCar performs against the competition. , and seeks to answer the following questions:
    
    What metric or metrics are you going to test?
        The study considers cost, fuel efficiency, horsepower, maintenance, and safety ratings.
        
    What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
        Null Hypothesis: MechaCar fuel efficiency is NOT better than the competition
        Alternate Hpyothese: MechaCar fuel efficiency on the highway is, on average, 5% better than the competition
        
        Similar null hypotheses might be tested for each metric, where we assume MechaCar is either better than the 
        competition by a factor of _n_ or is NOT better than the competition.

    What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
        Linear modeling would best determine if a correlation exists between cost and maintenance, or fuel efficiency and
        horsepower. 
        T-testing might be used to compare MechaCar statistics with competition statistics in similar populations.                 Comparing safety ratings of models with similar traits might give engineers and managers information to refine
        designs, or improve cost efficiencies.

    What data is needed to run the statistical test?
        Data would need to specify model, year, engine horsepower, cost (manufacturer's suggested retail price), safety             rating (by the same governing organization), to ensure similar populations. Comparing disimilar data will not
        positively contribute to company objectives.
